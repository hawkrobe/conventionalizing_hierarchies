	<h2><center>Fill the orders!</center>  </h2>

	<p>
	  In this experiment you will play a fun communication game
	  with another turker! Imagine that you work together in a
	  warehouse for the Shape Company and your goal is to fill
	  orders for customers. The company only sells these eight
	  objects:
	</p>

	<p>
	  <center>
	    <img src="images/all_objs.png" alt="Example objects"
		 style="width:642px; height:300px">
	  </center>
	</p>

	<p>
	  There are two jobs, which you and your partner will take
	  turns doing. The <b> Speaker </b> sees the target set
	  (i.e. which object or objects need to be packed up) and must
	  communicate this information to the <b> Listener </b> who
	  must pack them.
	</p>

	<p>
	  For each order, we will pick four of these eight objects and
	  show them to both of you. The objects will be shown in
	  different positions on your different screens. The objects in
	  the <b>target set</b> will be outlined in black for the
	  Speaker. Only the Speaker can see which objects are in the
	  order. In the example below, there is only one object in the
	  target set (the striped circle in the upper-left corner),
	  but other orders may have two objects in the target set!
	</p>

	<p>
	  <center>
	    <img src="images/cartoon2.png" alt="Task cartoon"
		 style="width:600px; height:616px">
	  </center>
	</p>
	
	<!-- <p> -->
	<!--   <center> -->
	<!--     <img src="images/screenshot_objs.png" alt="Example objects" -->
	<!-- 	 style="width:300px; height:300px"> -->
	<!--   </center> -->
	<!-- </p> -->

	<p>
	  The goal of the Speaker is to send a message so that the
	  Listener can correctly fill the order. If you are the
	  Listener, you will first need to wait until the Speaker has
	  sent their message before being able to click on the objects
	  you think they're telling you about. You'll both get <b> a
	  bonus of $0.05 when you correctly fill the order</b>
	  (i.e. when the Listener selects exactly the objects in the
	  target set), so pay attention!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  What makes this game more interesting and challenging is the
	  content of your messages: instead of using the English
	  language, you get to make up a language together! Both you
	  and your partner will see an array of 16 messages that
	  could be part of this language: to send one of the messages,
	  the Speaker can click and drag it into the grey 'dropzone'
	  below. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  <center>
	    <img src="images/screenshot_labels.png" alt="Example labels"
		 style="width:300px; height:300px">
	  </center>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  Once the Listener clicks on the object or objects they
	  believe are in the target set, they must click 'Done' and
	  both players will be given feedback. The Speaker will see
	  what the Listener clicked, and the Listener will see the
	  true target set. Then you will both automatically advance to
	  the next order and <b>switch roles</b>, so the Listener will
	  become the Speaker and vice versa. There are a total
	  of <b>96 rounds</b>. After the final round you will answer a
	  few more questions and be on your way.
	</p>

	<p>
	  A few final notes: First, since you are playing with
	  another player, you may see this screen before the game
	  begins:
	<p>
	  <center><img src="images/waitScreen.png" alt="initial matcher's board"
		       style="width:700px;height:150px">
	  </center>
	</p>
	Just hold tight. Another player should join the game within
	the next few minutes. If you're in the waiting room 15 minutes
	without another player joining, please return the HIT and try again later!
	</p>

	<p>
	  Second, please be respectful of the worker you're playing
	  with: pay close attention and try to be as responsive as
	  possible. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  Finally, please DO NOT refresh the page at any point once
	  you start the game (including the waiting page). If you
	  refresh, you will not be able to rejoin the game you were in
	  and you may not be able to submit the HIT. <br> Thank you!
	</p>
